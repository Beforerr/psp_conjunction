TODO: define alignment / conjunction

Our study focuses on the evolution of solar wind discontinuities within plasma parcels as they undergo expansion. We analyze datasets from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Earth-orbiting missions (e.g., ARTEMIS, DSCOVR, and Wind) at various radial distances in the inner heliosphere, during periods of conjunctions and alignments between PSP and these Earth-orbiting missions.

To achieve this, we utilize a configuration where two spacecraft are radially aligned in the Heliographic (HG) frame, with the longitude fixed on the Sun. It is important to note that the plasma parcels observed by the two spacecraft may differ in composition, as solar wind particles propagate at varying velocities. For instance, protons often exhibit a beam in their velocity distribution function, while the thermal speed of electrons is much higher than their bulk speed. Nonetheless, observing plasma that passes through both spacecraft offers the best opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind discontinuities with minimal influence from other processes during propagation. It is also expected that these plasma parcels evolve due to heating and other processes.

The plasma parcels in question are large-scale structures. As the scale size decreases below the mesoscale [@viallMesoscaleStructureSolar2021] (with radial sizes ranging from approximately 5 × 10³ km to 10⁷ km), it becomes increasingly unlikely to identify the same structure, depending on the latitude difference between the two spacecraft. Furthermore, although large-scale structures (especially density enhancements) can be identified as passing through both spacecraft [@berriotIdentificationSinglePlasma2024], it is nearly impossible to detect kinetic-scale structures, such as solar wind discontinuities (with time scales on the order of seconds), by both spacecraft simultaneously. Therefore, our study focuses on the statistical properties of solar wind discontinuities within the "same" large-scale structures that pass through both spacecraft.

After identifying the periods of conjunctions and alignments between PSP and Earth-orbiting missions, we apply the methodology described in [@???] to identify and characterize solar wind discontinuities. Generally, discontinuities observed by PSP are shorter (1-5 seconds) and exhibit higher current density. Consequently, we use different time windows for identifying discontinuities: 15 seconds for PSP and 30 seconds for Earth-orbiting missions. A example of the discontinuities observed by PSP is shown in @fig-examples.

PSP:
SWEAP consists of four separate sensors that measure the ions and electrons that make up the plasma in the solar wind and solar corona. The Solar Probe ANalyzer (SPAN) instruments are electrostatic analyzers (ESAs) that use curved plates to measure the 3-D particle distribution from within the shadow cast by the spacecraft thermal shield. Two of the sensors are co-located on the ram side of the spacecraft: SPAN-Ai measures ions, and SPAN-Ae measures electrons. SPAN-B measures electrons and is on the anti-ram side of the spacecraft. The Solar Probe Cup (SPC) is a Faraday Cup instrument that is directly illuminated by the Sun and measures both ions and electrons.

"Looking at your intervals, which occurred during the early phase of the mission when PSP was far from the Sun, I realize that the plasma data wasn't good for your purpose because (1) SPAN-ion during at least the first 3-4 orbits did not measure the solar wind well, since a good portion of the solar wind distributions was out of view of that instrument, and (2) data from SPC (Farady Cup) does not give good temperature data. I am wondering if you have conjunction events that occurred later, say starting Encounter 7, when data from SPAN would be accurate. If not, some parts of Encounters 4-6 might be OK."

For this study

We utilized high-resolution magnetic field and plasma data from the FIELDS and SWEAP instruments aboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). For the plasma data presented in the figures of this paper, we used the dataset from SPAN-i, which measures ions in the solar wind. Although ion data is also available from SPC, the SPAN-i data was chosen due to its higher temporal resolution, making it more suitable for analyzing discontinuities. Our analysis confirms that the results obtained from SPC are consistent with those derived from SPAN-i data. It is also worth noting that sqtn data from the Radio Frequency Spectrometer (RFS) and Low-Frequency Receiver (LFR) for density measurements is available. However, we generally find that the results obtained from RFS/LFR do not differ significantly from those derived from SPAN-i data. Due to the limitations of SPAN-i data during the early mission phases, when a significant portion of the solar wind distributions was out of the instrument’s view, our study concentrates on data beginning with Encounter 7, where SPAN-i provides more accurate measurements.

ARTEMIS:
We use the following data collected by ARTEMIS P1: magnetic fields with a ∼4s spin resolution (Auster et al. 2008), the ion bulk velocity v, and the ion (assumed to be proton) temperature (scalar) Tp calculated from velocity distributions measured at spin resolution by the Electrostatic Analyzer (ESA; McFadden et al. 2008). Being designed for measurements of a hot, rarefied plasma in Earth’s magnetosphere, ESA typically overestimates the proton temperature in the solar wind, because the solar wind proton beam is narrower than ESA’s energy and angular resolution.
TODO: check if the ESA is in solar wind mode
-->

We utilized data collected by ARTEMIS, including magnetic fields measured at approximately 5 Hz resolution by the Fluxgate Magnetometer [@austerTHEMISFluxgateMagnetometer2008], as well as plasma velocity ($v$) and density ($n$), which were derived from velocity distribution data obtained by the Electrostatic Analyzer with a resolution of around 4 seconds [@mcfaddenTHEMISESAPlasma2009]. It is important to note that the ESA tends to overestimate proton temperature in the solar wind due to the narrower proton beam compared to the ESA’s energy and angular resolution. Therefore, any findings related to temperature anisotropy should be interpreted with caution.

WIND:

Instrument Description
The Wind 3DP instrument consists of six different sensors. There are two electron (EESA) and two ion (PESA) electrostatic analyzers with different geometrical factors and field-of-views covering the energy range from 3 eV to 30 keV. There are also a pair of solid state telescopes (SST) that measure electrons with energies up to 400 keV and protons with energie

The following data collected by Wind are used: magnetic fields with a $\sim 11$ Hz resolution measured by the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) [@leppingWINDMagneticField1995], the ion (proton and alpha) moments measured by ion (PESA) electrostatic analyzers of the 3D Plasma Analyzer (3DP) [@linThreedimensionalPlasmaEnergetic1995].

## Comparison between Alfven speed and plasma speed change

For rotational discontinuities, the plasma velocity jump across them: the plasma flow velocity $v_l$ (the solar wind velocity projected onto $l$) changes due to changes in $B_l$, $Δv_l=±Δv_A$ with $v_A= B_l / \sqrt{4 n m}$.

![](figures/enc7/dvl.png)

K2: $Δv_l$,l demonstrates a strong correlation with $Δv_{A}$, albeit being consistently smaller.

## Estimated Anisotropy

The equation for $Δv_A$ includes a factor depending on the anisotropy of the plasma.

Pressure anisotropy $Λ = \mu (P_∥ - P_⊥) / B^2$.

## Comparison between Estimated and Observed Anisotropy

# Discussion


- The properties of the discontinuities is related to the local plasma parameters
  - Thickness => ion inertial length
  - Current density => Alfven velocity (current density)

- Normalized thickness and current density of discontinuities remain constant with radial distance. In contrast to @artemyevDynamicsIntenseCurrents2018 results that show a decrease  in normalized thickness and increase in normalized current density with radial distance.

Assuming the 
Anisotropy of the plasma is expected to be larger near the sun to explain the observed speed change ratio $Δv_i/Δv_A$.

- Abstract:: Configurations in which two spacecraft, such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter, are radially aligned provide opportunities for studying the evolution of a single solar wind parcel during so-called plasma line-ups. The most critical part of these studies arguably is the identification of what can be considered the same plasma crossing both spacecraft. We present here a method that allowed us to determine what we think to be the same plasma parcel that passed through PSP (∼0.075 au) and Solar Orbiter (∼0.9 au) after their radial alignment on April 29, 2021. We started by modeling the plasma propagation in order to obtain a first estimation of the plasma line-up intervals. The identification of the same density structure (with a crossing duration ∼1.5 h) that passed through the two spacecraft allowed us to specify and confirm this estimate. Our main finding is that the density structure was very stable and remained well recognizable from PSP to Solar Orbiter despite its journey of ∼137 hours in the inner heliosphere. We found, moreover, that the slow solar wind plasma parcel was significantly accelerated (from ∼200 to ∼300 km s<sup>−1<sup/>) during its propagation.

- Quotes::
  - Moreover, the terms “plasma line-up” and “plasma parcel” are somewhat ill-defined, as discussed in Schwartz & Marsch (1983). For example, the particle populations of the solar wind tend to propagate with different velocities. The protons often exhibit a beam in their velocity distribution function, the thermal speed of the electrons is much higher than their bulk speed, and alpha particles usually have a different bulk speed than protons (see Marsch 2012, and references therein). Furthermore, halo electrons are probably governed by nonlocal scattering mechanisms (Zaslavsky et al. 2024). We prefer to keep the general terminology “plasma parcel” and “line-up” throughout this study, however.
