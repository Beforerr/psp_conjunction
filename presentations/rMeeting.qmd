## Examples of discontinuities

![](../figures/examples/psp_e2_example.png)

In general discontinuities observed by PSP are with

- shorter duration (1~5 secs)
  
  compared with 5-10 secs

- large current density (100-1000 nA/m^2)
  
  compared with 1-10 nA/m^2

## Properties of discontinuities

![](../figures/examples/psp_e2_example.png)

Every discontinuity's $l$ component is fitted by a $\tanh$ (logistic) function.

Combined with plasma data ($n$, $v$, $T$)

$L$: thickness of the discontinuity

$J_0$: maxium current density

---

If we expect the discontinuities to be generated locally, then the thickness of the discontinuities should be related to local plasma parameters:

- Normalize thickness by $d_i$ (ion inertial length) or $r_i$ (ion gyroradius)
- Normalize current density by $J_A$ (Alfven current density)

<!-- 
The radial dependence of the proton number density, $n_p$ and magnetic ﬁeld magnitude, $B$, is given by

$$
n_p = (2.4 ± 0.1)(R/R_0)^{−(1.96±0.07)} cm^{−3}
$$

$$
B = (5.7 ± 0.2)(R/R_0)^{−(1.59±0.06)} nT
$$

The faster decrease of the magnetic than kinetic pressure is reﬂected in the radial proton plasma beta variation

$$
β_p = P_k/P_B = (0.55 ± 0.04)(R/R_0)^{(0.4±0.1)}

K1: Normalized discontinuities properties does not vary much with radial distance

K2: $Δv_l$,l demonstrates a strong correlation with $Δv_{A}$, albeit being consistently smaller.

## Comparison with Alfven speed and plasma speed change

For rotational discontinuities, the plasma velocity jump across them: the plasma ﬂow velocity $v_l$ (the solar wind velocity projected onto $l$) changes due to changes in $B_l$, $Δv_l=±Δv_A$ with $v_A= B_l / \sqrt{4 n m}$ [@hudsonDiscontinuitiesAnisotropicPlasma1970].

## Comparison with anisotropy

The equation for $Δv_A$ includes a factor depending on the anisotropy of the plasma.

![](../figures/enc2/anisotropy.spi_n_spi.png)

Pressure anisotropy $Λ = \mu (P_∥ - P_⊥) / B^2$.

## Conclusion

- The properties of the discontinuities is related to the local plasma parameters
  - Thickness => ion inertial length
  - Current density => Alfven velocity (current density)
- Normalized thickness and current density of discontinuities remain constant with radial distance
- Anisotropy of the plasma is expected to be larger near the sun to explain the observed speed change ratio $Δv_i/Δv_A$.
