PSP:
SWEAP consists of four separate sensors that measure the ions and electrons that make up the plasma in the solar wind and solar corona. The Solar Probe ANalyzer (SPAN) instruments are electrostatic analyzers (ESAs) that use curved plates to measure the 3-D particle distribution from within the shadow cast by the spacecraft thermal shield. Two of the sensors are co-located on the ram side of the spacecraft: SPAN-Ai measures ions, and SPAN-Ae measures electrons. SPAN-B measures electrons and is on the anti-ram side of the spacecraft. The Solar Probe Cup (SPC) is a Faraday Cup instrument that is directly illuminated by the Sun and measures both ions and electrons.

"Looking at your intervals, which occurred during the early phase of the mission when PSP was far from the Sun, I realize that the plasma data wasn't good for your purpose because (1) SPAN-ion during at least the first 3-4 orbits did not measure the solar wind well, since a good portion of the solar wind distributions was out of view of that instrument, and (2) data from SPC (Farady Cup) does not give good temperature data. I am wondering if you have conjunction events that occurred later, say starting Encounter 7, when data from SPAN would be accurate. If not, some parts of Encounters 4-6 might be OK."

We utilized high-resolution magnetic field and plasma data from the FIELDS and SWEAP instruments aboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). For the plasma data presented in the figures of this paper, we used the dataset from SPAN-i, which measures ions in the solar wind. Although ion data is also available from SPC, the SPAN-i data was chosen due to its higher temporal resolution, making it more suitable for analyzing discontinuities. Our analysis confirms that the results obtained from SPC are consistent with those derived from SPAN-i data. It is also worth noting that sqtn data from the Radio Frequency Spectrometer (RFS) and Low-Frequency Receiver (LFR) for density measurements is available. However, we generally find that the results obtained from RFS/LFR do not differ significantly from those derived from SPAN-i data. Due to the limitations of SPAN-i data during the early mission phases, when a significant portion of the solar wind distributions was out of the instrument’s view, our study concentrates on data beginning with Encounter 7, where SPAN-i provides more accurate measurements.
