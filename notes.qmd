# Updates

- [x] Why ARTEMIS electron data and Wind ion data?
- [ ] Disagreement between anisotropy observed and predicted by the theory
  - maybe just too localized anisotropy that is not well measured with available time resolution... 
  - or maybe more complex ion distribution, where nongyrotropy is more important than anisotropy


# Motivation

Studying the radial evolution of solar wind discontinuities from synergistic observations of PSP and Earth-orbiting missions (ARTEMIS, Wind) during aligned intervals.

- How does the discontinuities change with the radial distance from the Sun?

- How is solar wind discontinuities formed? What is the physical mechanisms?

  - Generated at or near the sun?

  - Locally generated in the interplanetary space by turbulence?


# TODO

- [ ] Plot Bl(t), jm(l) and ion anisotropy for these cases?

The radial dependence of the proton number density, $n_p$ and magnetic ﬁeld magnitude, $B$, is given by

$$
n_p = (2.4 ± 0.1)(R/R_0)^{−(1.96±0.07)} cm^{−3}
\\
B = (5.7 ± 0.2)(R/R_0)^{−(1.59±0.06)} nT
$$

The faster decrease of the magnetic than kinetic pressure is reflected in the radial proton plasma beta variation

$$
β_p = P_k/P_B = (0.55 ± 0.04)(R/R_0)^{(0.4±0.1)}
$$

# Research notes

## In-situ synergistic observations (Alignment)

**Similar** type of solar wind or **Same** solar solar wind

How to define alignment?

- Trajectory & Orbits (theory): ballistic approximation of Parker spiral

- Plasma properties (observation): 

  - Invariants: plasma composition, ionization states, mass flux $n u r^2$

  - Correlation: magnetic field / plasma velocity

- Simulation: Trace plasma parcels evolution

## Anisotropy

### Estimated Anisotropy

@shenComparingPlasmaAnisotropy2024


The equation for $Δv_A$ includes a factor depending on the anisotropy of the plasma.

Pressure anisotropy $Λ = \mu (P_∥ - P_⊥) / B^2$.
